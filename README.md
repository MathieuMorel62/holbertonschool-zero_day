## Description
### Git - The Ultimate Version Control System

Git is an open-source version control system designed to manage software development projects efficiently and reliably. It tracks changes made to a project and allows multiple developers to collaborate on the same project.

### Advantages of Git

- **Complete Change History:** Git keeps a complete history of all changes made to a project, allowing you to see who did what and when.
- **Real-Time Collaboration:** Git allows multiple developers to work on the same project at the same time, facilitating collaboration and speeding up development.
- **Easy Branching and Merging:** Git allows you to create branches for different versions of your project, enabling you to work on different features without interfering with the main development. Merging branches is also a straightforward process with Git.
- **Security:** Git keeps a copy of every version of your project, meaning you can always revert to an earlier version if needed.

### How to Use Git

To use Git, you must first install it on your computer. You can find installation instructions for your operating system on the Git website.
  
Once installed, you can initialize a Git repository for your project using the `git init` command. You can then add files to your repository using the `git add` command.
  
To save changes made to your project, you can use the `git commit` command. This will save the changes in the history of your Git repository.
  
Git is a powerful and highly useful tool for developers. If you have never used Git before, I recommend getting familiar with the basics by following online tutorials or reading the official documentation.

### 'General'
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/), **without the help of Google:**

<details>
<summary>What is source code management</summary>
<br>

>Source code management (SCM) is the process of tracking and controlling changes to software source code. It is a critical component of software development and helps ensure the integrity, reliability, and maintainability of the codebase.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is Git</summary>
<br>

>Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system designed to manage software development projects efficiently and reliably. It allows developers to track changes made to the code, collaborate with other developers, and maintain a history of the project.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is GitHub</summary>
<br>

>GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories. It is a popular platform for hosting open-source projects and allows developers to collaborate, share, and review code. GitHub also provides tools for project management, issue tracking, and wikis.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is the difference between Git and GitHub</summary>
<br>

>Git is a version control system, while GitHub is a web-based platform for hosting Git repositories. Git is used to manage and track changes to code, while GitHub provides a platform for hosting and sharing Git repositories, as well as additional tools for project management and collaboration.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to create a repository</summary>
<br>

>To create a repository on GitHub, log in to your account, click on the "+" icon in the top right corner, and select "New repository". Enter a name for your repository, choose whether it should be public or private, and add a description. Then click "Create repository".
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is a README</summary>
<br>

>A README is a text file that provides information about a project, including its purpose, how to use it, and how to contribute. It is usually the first file that a person sees when they visit a repository on GitHub.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to write good READMEs</summary>
<br>

>To write a good README, make sure to include the following information: Project name and purpose, Installation instructions, Usage instructions, List of contributors, Links to any related projects, License information and the Contact information for questions or support
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to commit</summary>
<br>

>To commit changes in Git, you must first stage the changes using the `git add` command. Then use the `git commit` command to save the changes, with a message describing the changes you made.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to write helpful commit messages</summary>
<br>

>How to write helpful commit messages: When writing commit messages, make sure to include a brief description of the changes made, why they were made, and any relevant context. Use clear, concise language and write in the present tense.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to push code</summary>
<br>

>To push code to a remote repository, use the `git push` command. You will need to specify the name of the remote repository and the name of the branch you want to push.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to pull updates</summary>
<br>

>To pull updates from a remote repository, use the `git pull` command. You will need to specify the name of the remote repository and the name of the branch you want to pull from.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to create a branch</summary>
<br>

>To create a new branch in Git, use the `git branch` command, followed by the name of the new branch.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to merge branches</summary>
<br>

>To merge one branch into another, first checkout the branch you want to merge into, then use the `git merge` command, followed by the name of the branch you want to merge.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to work as collaborators on a project</summary>
<br>

>To work as collaborators on a project, each person must have a GitHub account and be added as a collaborator to the repository. Collaborators can then clone the repository, make changes, and push their changes to the remote repository.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Which files should and which files should not appear in your repo</summary>
<br>

>It is important to keep the repository organized and avoid including files that are not necessary for the project. Some common files that should appear in a repo include: Source code files, Assets (such as images or audio files), Documentation (such as README files). Files that should not be included in a repo include: Build artifacts, Binaries, Temporary files, Large files that are not essential to the project and Sensitive information, such as passwords or private keys.
