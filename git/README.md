# TASKS


### [0. Create And Setup Your Git And Github Account](url)
  
  - Clone your repository.
  - Navigate to this new directory.
  - Add this new file to git, commit the change with this message “My first commit” and push to the remote server / origin

--------------------------------

### [1. Repo-Session](url)


Create a new directory called git in your repo.  

Make sure you include a not empty README.md in your directory:

   - at the root of your repository
   - AND in the directory git

And important part: __Make sure your commit and push your code to Github - otherwise the Checker will always fail.__

----------------------------------

### [2. Coding Fury Road](url)

For the moment we have an empty project directory containing only a README.md. It’s time to code !

  - Create these directories at the root of your project: bash, c, js
  - Create these empty files:

        c/c_is_fun.c

        js/main.js

        js/index.js

 - Create a file bash/best with these two lines inside: #!/bin/bash and echo "Best"
 - Create a file bash/school with these two lines inside: #!/bin/bash and echo "School"
 - Add all these new files to git
 - Commit your changes (message: “Starting to code today, so cool”) and push to the remote server

---------------------------------------

### [3. Collaboration Is The Base Of a Company](url)


A branch is like a copy of your project. It’s used mainly for:  
    
  - adding a feature in development
  - collaborating on the same project with other developers
  - not breaking your entire repository
  - not upsetting your co-workers
  
  
The purpose of a branch is to isolate your work from the main code base of your project and/or from your co-workers’ work.

For this project, create a branch update_script and in this branch:

  - Create an empty file named bash/98
  - Update bash/best by replacing echo "Best" with echo "Best School"
  - Update bash/school by replacing echo "School" with echo "The school is open!"
  - Add and commit these changes (message: “My personal work”)
  - Push this new branch Tips

Perfect! You did an amazing update in your project and it’s isolated correctly from the main branch.

Ho wait, your manager needs a quick fix in your project and it needs to be deployed now:

  - Change branch to main
  - Update the file bash/best by replacing echo "Best" with echo "This School is so cool!"
  - Delete the directory js
  - Commit your changes (message: “Hot fix”) and push to the origin
 
-----------------------------------

### [4. Collaboration: Be Up To Date](url)

Of course, you can also work on the same branch as your co-workers and it’s best if you keep up to date with their changes.  
 
For this task – and only for this task – please update your file README.md in the main branch from GitHub.com. It’s the only time you are allowed to update and commit from GitHub interface.

After you have done that, in your terminal:

  - Get all changes of the main branch locally (i.e. your README.md file will be updated)
  - Create a new file up_to_date at the root of your directory and in it, write the git command line used
  - Add up_to_date to git, commit (message: “How to be up to date in git”), and push to the origin

----------------------------------

### [5. Haaa What Did You Do ???](url)

Collaboration is cool, but not really when you update the same file at the same time…

To illustrate that, please merge the branch update_script to main: “Cool, all my changes will be now part of the main branch, ready to be deployed!”

    HHHHHHHAAAAAAAA
 
    CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in bash/best

As you can see, you have conflicts between two branches on the same file.

Your goal now is to resolve conflicts by using the version of the branch update_script, and push the result to the origin.

At the end, you should have all your work from the branch update_script (new file and two updated files) and all latest main commits (new files, delete folder, etc.), without conflicts.

-----------------------------------

### [6. Never Push Too Much](url)

Create a .gitignore file and define a rule to never push ~ files (generated by Emacs).
